    NOTE: when it comes to integer overflow, if you have a u8 and try to assign it a value larger than 255, an overflow will occur. In debug mode, rust will check for this and 
    panic at runtime if overflow occurs. If you compile in release mode with the `--release` flag, rust will not check for overflows that cause panic. If an overflow occurs, 
    Rust perform "two's compliment wrapping", meaning that values greater than max value the type can hold will wrap around. This will not cause panic, but if you have a u8 
    value of 256, it will be reassigned to 1, which is probably not what you're expecting. To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use families of methods
    that the standard library provides on primitive numeric types:
        * Wrap all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`
        * Return the `None` value if there is an overflow with the `checked_*` methods
        * Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was an overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods
        * Saturate at the values minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*` methods
